## Overview üêù
[**Honeygain-Pot**](https://bit.ly/3x6nX1S) üçØ is a script (bot) powered by NodeJS, JavaScript and Shell scripting to automatically claim your lucky pot bonus daily from [**Honeygain**](https://bit.ly/3x6nX1S)üêù.

The script is designed to be run in a docker environment, allowing it to be deployed alongside the Honeygain docker container.

## Usage üìÉ
Define the following environment variable to bootstrap the image.

| Variable | Description | Mandatory |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **EMAIL**     | Your Honeygain email address    | YES |
| **PASSWORD**  | Your Honeygain password         | YES |

Or supply credentials in a Dotenv `.env` file.
```markdown
EMAIL=<email_address>
PASSWORD=<password_credential>
```

## Docker Deployment üêã
### Compose
File: `compose.yml`
```yaml
services:
  honeygain-pot:
    container_name: honeygain-pot
    image: ghcr.io/xterna/honeygain-pot
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - EMAIL=$EMAIL
      - PASSWORD=$PASSWORD
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8
```

With Honeygain app docker image.
```yaml
services:
  honeygain:
    container_name: honeygain
    image: honeygain/honeygain
    restart: always
    command: -tou-accept -email $EMAIL -pass $PASSWORD -device $<name_to_identify_device>
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8

  honeygain-pot:
    container_name: honeygain-pot
    image: xterna/honeygain-pot
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - EMAIL=$EMAIL
      - PASSWORD=$PASSWORD
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8
    depends_on:
      - honeygain
```

Execute where compose file is located.
```yaml
docker compose up -d
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** If you apply resource limits such as CPU and RAM you need to set the following bare minimum:
```
  - cpu=0.8
  - mem_limit=350m
```
The script won't be able to run properly and will constantly timeout if the CPU and RAM limit is set lower than recommended. This is only required during the boot-up phase where it needs to spin up a headless browser to connect to the site. Resource is most intensive only during this phase.

### CLI
Using environment variable or Dotenv `.env` defined e.g.
```sh
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name honeygain-pot -e EMAIL=$HONEYGAIN_EMAIL -e PASSWORD=$HONEYGAIN_PASSWORD ghcr.io/xterna/honeygain-pot
```

Directly passing credentials.
```sh
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name honeygain-pot -e EMAIL=example.gmail.com -e PASSWORD=pass123 ghcr.io/xterna/honeygain-pot
```
This will start the application in the background. The alias assigned is `honeygain-pot`.
